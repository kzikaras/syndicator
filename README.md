[Syndicator](https://kzikarassyndicator.herokuapp.com/)

The Syndicator application allows a user to submit events to a database. Every hour newly added events are submitted to several different events websites.
The app uses the Mechanize gem to perform web crawling functions to post the events, as well as Rufus-Scheduler to schedule event posting to external websites.
